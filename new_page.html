<h1><center>Project Super</h1>
<p>Welcome to the headquorters of everything fitness, and everything your looking for.</p>

<h3><center>Level #1</h3>
<p>Let's start simple. You need to get in a Caloric Deficit. A Caloric Deficit is when the amount of calories you burn each day exceeds the amoubr of calories you consume.</p>
<p>Example: 1000 calories consumed < 1500 calories burnt.</p>

<h3><center>Level 2</h3>
<p>Now that you understand deficits, let's add one thing. Protein, and lots of it. Protein is what you need to rebuild your muscle fibers after every work. to optimize muscle growth and recovery, you she have at least 10 grams of protein with in 30 minutes after you workout, or after any demanding physical activity for that matter.</p>
<p>Multiply your body weight in pounds by 0.7, the result is the bare minimum amount of grams of protein you should be having each day</p>
<p>Example: 145lbs x 0.7 = 101.5 grams</p>
